Breast Cancer Detection Project
Project Description
This project aims to leverage Machine Learning techniques to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer. Breast cancer is a prevalent malignancy among women, constituting a significant portion of cancer diagnoses and contributing substantially to cancer-related deaths. The growth of abnormal cells in breast tissue leads to the formation of tumors, which can be benign, pre-malignant, or malignant. Traditional diagnostic methods include MRI, mammogram, ultrasound, and biopsy.

1. Identify the Problem
Breast cancer is a complex and challenging health issue. The goal of this project is to create a predictive model using machine learning, specifically for breast fine needle aspiration (FNA) test results. The FNA test is a quick procedure that extracts fluid or cells from a breast lesion or cyst. The model will classify tumors into two categories:

1 = Malignant (Cancerous) - Present
0 = Benign (Not Cancerous) - Absent
1.1 Expected Outcome
The expected outcome is a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying breast cancer tumors based on FNA test results. This model aims to assist in the early detection of breast cancer, providing valuable information for medical professionals to make informed decisions.

1.2 Objective
The primary objective is to address breast cancer as a classification problem. The focus is on predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant, enabling the identification of potential recurrence and non-recurrence of malignant cases over a specified period. Machine learning classification methods will be employed to train a model that can predict the discrete class of new input data.

1.3 Identify Data Sources
The Breast Cancer dataset used in this project is sourced from the machine learning repository maintained by the University of California, Irvine. The dataset consists of 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells. Key features include unique ID numbers, diagnoses (M = malignant, B = benign), and 30 real-value features computed from digitized images of cell nuclei.
